## Project Description

Card Memory Game is a game that I have built during taking classes at General Assembly. This is a 2 players' Vanilla Java Script game. 

The rules are the following: players need to pick pairs of cards that match (are the same) in turns. The goal of the game is to guess as many card pairs as possible. The game ends if all of the cards have been guessed, or with the timer - in 2 min after the start.

Bugs: 

- timer starts before user clicks's "start";
- cards get stuck sometimes if you click them multiple times;
- game's dimensions are not quite responsive per screens with different sizes.

Upcoming features:

- bug fixes;
- added animations when card match;
- a window with instructions.

## User Stories

#### As a player I want:
-  to be able to input and see my name on the screen;
- to keep a track of time and see a time count on the screen, as well as my current score;
- to be able and open 2 cards (one after another) per each players turn, to see if the cards match;
- if the cards match to automatically  remove from the screen, and convert to the player's score; 
-  to see cards that were opened by the other player;
- to see the result of the game once it ended.


### MVP Goals
Welcome screen to enter each player's name.
Game screen with a set of hidden cards, which show their value once are clicked.
Game ends once the timer finishes or when all of the cards have been guessed.
To show a window with a "congartulations message". 

### Stretch Goals
- add audio;
- add animated flip-transition when a card is pressed.
